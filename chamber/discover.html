               <p>The Alberto Jos√© Armando Stadium is a football stadium located in La Boca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p><br>
               <p>La Bombonera is the heart of Boca Juniors, and one of the most famous stadiums in the world, thanks to the party that takes place there during each game. It is not a show that takes place only indoors, but the streets of the neighborhood begin to throb with emotion even hours before it begins.</p>
            <br><h2>Fun Fact</h2><br>
            <p>According to the English newspapers The Observer and The Sun, going to La Bombonera to watch a match between Boca Juniors and River Plate is "the most intense sports experience in the world" and "number one among the 50 sports shows that you have to watch before you die‚Äù</p>

                <p>Caminito is one of the most emblematic walks in the City and one of the must-see attractions for those who visit it.</p><br>
               <p>For a long time it was part of the route of the railway to Ensenada until, in 1928, the branch was closed and the track became an abandoned alley. Thanks to the initiative of several neighbors in 1950 the land was recovered to turn it into a pedestrian walkway and a museum street.</p>
            <br><h2>Fun Fact</h2><br>
            <p>Its sinuous layout is due to the fact that it follows the river that flowed there until the beginning of the 20th century. The area was popularly known as "Puntin" (diminutive of "bridge" in Genoese dialect).</p>

             <p>Tango is one of the axes of the activities that the building houses with milongas, live shows and exhibitions to the rhythm of 2√ó4. In fact, it was declared by the Buenos Aires government as "Official and exclusive room of tango in the City",</p>

                <p>This building, whose architecture corresponds to Catalan modernism, was built in 1910 under the direction of the architect Guillermo √Ålvarez.</p><br>
                <p>The work was done at the request of Mrs. Auvert Aurnaud, one of the richest people in the city at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
             <br><h2>Fun Fact</h2><br>
             <p>Its first owner enjoyed it for just a year; she then rented it out to various artists in the area. One of them committed suicide by jumping from the tower. Since then, stories of strange appearances in the building have been around the neighborhood and it became popular as "the Tower of the Ghost".</p>

                <p>The construction of the Usina del Arte, in Florentine style with exposed brick, dates back to 1916 and is the work of the Italian architect Juan Chiogna.</p><br>
                <p>The building also has different spaces for dance performances, plastic arts exhibitions, samples and exhibitions. The central nave, with its facades covered in Paris stone and a granite base, has moldings and capitals of great testimonial value.</p>
             <br><h2>Fun Fact</h2><br>
             <p>The Usina del Arte has a symphony hall with capacity for 1,200 people that was designed based on the pattern of the Berlage hall in Amsterdam. Its acoustics, which are optimal, deserve a separate chapter, since the structure of the building and the thickness of its walls were used to the maximum.</p>
